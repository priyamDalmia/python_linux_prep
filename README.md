## Advanced Python and Linux Resources

This repo contains snippets, tutorials and projects, and essentially all the resources that I used when preparing for the Python - [PCPP]() L1 and L2 certifications . It also includes some Linux scripts and notes along with some python scripting tools that I used for the [LFCS]() systems administrator exam.
